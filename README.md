# amazon_reviews_sentiment_analysis

In this project, I developed a Python application for Sentiment Analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal was to classify the sentiment of Amazon customer reviews, helping businesses understand customer feedback more effectively.

I employed two main methods for sentiment analysis: NLTK's VADER and Huggingface's Roberta Transformers. NLTK's VADER is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is easy to use and provides quick insights into sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral). On the other hand, Huggingface's Roberta Transformers utilize deep learning models pretrained on vast amounts of text data, offering more sophisticated understanding and nuanced sentiment analysis capabilities.

The project compares the performance of these two methods, highlighting their strengths and differences in sentiment classification accuracy. This comparison is crucial for understanding which method is more suitable for different types of data or tasks.

Sentiment analysis is essential for businesses to gauge customer satisfaction, monitor product reviews, and improve customer experience strategies. By automating this process with Python, businesses can efficiently analyze large volumes of text data and derive actionable insights.
